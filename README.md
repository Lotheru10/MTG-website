## User Authentication (Login and Registration)
Before accessing the main page, users must log in.
If they do not have an account, they can register using a dedicated form.

## Home Page â€“ Card Browsing
Users can browse available cards, displayed as images along with basic information.

## Card Details
Clicking on a card opens a modal with details such as name, rarity, type, color, and price.
In the modal, users can also add opinions about the cards.

## Deck Management
Users can create new decks using a form available on the dedicated "Decks" page.
Once a deck is created, users can add cards to it from the gallery.

## Adding Cards to a Deck
By clicking on a card, users can select a deck to which they want to add it.
After adding a card, it is assigned to the chosen deck, and the application state is updated accordingly.
